1. You have studied concept of semaphore. Also you are aware of c library functions for semaphores. Now explore semaphores from /sys/sem.h ( from where you explored queues and shared memory). Enlist system calls related to semaphore. 

2. Implement Producer consumer example between processes using semaphore. Consider There is some producing processes and some consuming processes.
Implement using both; c library functions and system calls.

3. Consider the problem of readers writers solved in previous assignment with THREE different cases. Implement it using system calls.

4. There is a bus reservation system. A bus has 52 seats total. There are 5 ticket sellers on the bus stop. A seat can be allocated to single passenger. Ensure it using Binary Semaphore. Also Implement the same using mutex. Differentiate mutex with binary semaphore.
