1. Can mutex be locked by same thread again who has already locked it? Give at least THREE use cases of it. Explore the concept of reentrant mutex.  

Explore pthread_mutexattr_init, pthread_mutexattr_settype, pthread_mutex_init. Explore different mutex attributes. Enlist types of mutex.

2. Implement readers -writers lock using mutex with 1) Readers having priority 2) Writers having priority and 3)unspecified priority.

Explore the issues from three cases. 

3. Explore the Read copy update lock. Try to implement it using mutex.
Enlist the issues encountered. What is passive serialization?

4. Use spinlock in all demo codes where you used mutex. And explore the difference between both. 

5. Implement concurrent programming where two threds of execution increments the count initialized to 0. T1 increments count from 0 to 4 and from 7 to 10. T2 increments count from 4 to 7. Once count reaches 10; execution terminates. T1 and T2 also writes current count value with which updated it.

6. Implement readers -writers lock using semaphore with 1) Readers having priority 2) Writers having priority and 3)unspecified priority.
