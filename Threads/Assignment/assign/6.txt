a.  pthread_attr_init() 
	The pthread_attr_init() function initializes the thread attributes
       object pointed to by attr with default attribute values.  After this
       call, individual attributes of the object can be set using various
       related functions (listed under SEE ALSO), and then the object can be
       used in one or more pthread_create(3) calls that create threads.

       Calling pthread_attr_init() on a thread attributes object that has
       already been initialized results in undefined behavior.
