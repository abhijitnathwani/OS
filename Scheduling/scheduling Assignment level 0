1) Explore and explain detailed use of sched_yield, CPU_ALLOC, CPU_ZERO, CPU_SET, sched_setaffinity, sched_getaffinity, sched_setscheduler, sched_getscheduler with prototypes and each options available. 
You need to explore task_struct and sched_param strucures.

2) Allocate CPU for different threads as thread attributes.

3) Explain different performance indices for scheduler. Make relative analysis based on different performance parameters for scheduling policies: FCFS, RR, SPN, SRF, HRRF for below mentioned table of activities.
Jobs 	Arrival time	Service Time
A	0		4
B	3		7
C	4		3
D	6		5
E	8		2

4) Explore short term , medium term and long term scheduler? In which condition each will be invoked? Compare based on frequency of invokation.

5) What is preemptive and non preemptive scheduling?

6) What is priority based scheduling? How policy helps in that?

7) What is dispatcher? what it does?

8) Explain Completely fair scheduler.

9) Explain loosely coupled or distributed multiprocessor systems, Functionally specialized processors systems and Tightly coupled multi processor systems.

10) What is granularity? What different levels of same specifies?

11) Explain types of thread scheduling. a) load sharing, gang, dedicated, dynamic

12) Which are the scheduler design issues with multiprocessor systems?
